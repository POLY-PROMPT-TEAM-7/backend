  "prompt": "# Mission: Agent Pipeline Rework\n\nYour objective is to execute the implementation plan located at `./.sisyphus/plans/agent-pipeline-rework.md` to restructure the LangGraph agent pipeline. \n\n## ⚠️ Critical Environment Context\n**THERE ARE NO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CONFIGURED.**\n- `CANVAS_API_KEY` is not set.\n- `OPENALEX_API_KEY` is not set.\n- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or any other LLM provider keys) are not set.\n\n**What this means for your execution:**\n1. **Graceful Degradation is strictly enforced:** You must ensure that the missing Canvas and OpenAlex keys do not crash the pipeline. The fallback logic (returning state unchanged) must work flawlessly under these conditions.\n2. **Testing:** When running the mandatory QA scenarios (e.g., `python -c ...`), you will need to either rely on the graceful degradation handling empty keys, or temporarily mock/stub necessary variables within your bash commands if a specific test requires it.\n\n## Execution Rules\n\n1. **Follow the Waves:** Execute the plan strictly according to the defined Parallel Execution Waves (Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Wave 3 → Wave FINAL). Do not start a subsequent wave until the current one is fully complete and verified.\n2. **Zero Human Intervention:** You are responsible for all QA. Execute the exact Bash/Python verification commands listed under the \"QA Scenarios\" for each task.\n3. **Save Evidence:** Write the output of all passing QA scenarios to their respective `.sisyphus/evidence/task-{N}-*.txt` files as dictated by the plan.\n4. **Adhere to Guardrails:** Pay special attention to the \"Must NOT Have\" sections. Do not add logging, do not parse documents, and do not modify the external schema classes.\n5. **Commit Strategy:** Use the exact commit messages outlined in the \"Commit Strategy\" section of the plan at the end of each wave.\n\nBegin execution with Wave 1, Task 1.\n",
